These folders contain the simulation files which have been used to derive the simulation results in the paper.

Note that we only included the sources and not the final results, like the extracted parasitic networks, due to non-disclosure agreements on the used tools and libraries. However, at some points we added some parts of the open-source Involution Tool, which is available at https://github.com/oehlinscher/InvolutionTool. The corresponding files are marked by a Copyright notice.
